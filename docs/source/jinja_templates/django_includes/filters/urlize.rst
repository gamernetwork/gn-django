.. templatefilter:: urlize

.. function:: urlize

    Converts URLs and email addresses in text into clickable links.
    
    This template tag works on links prefixed with ``http://``, ``https://``, or
    ``www.``. For example, ``https://goo.gl/aia1t`` will get converted but
    ``goo.gl/aia1t`` won't.
    
    It also supports domain-only links ending in one of the original top level
    domains (``.com``, ``.edu``, ``.gov``, ``.int``, ``.mil``, ``.net``, and
    ``.org``). For example, ``djangoproject.com`` gets converted.
    
    Links can have trailing punctuation (periods, commas, close-parens) and leading
    punctuation (opening parens), and ``urlize`` will still do the right thing.
    
    Links generated by ``urlize`` have a ``rel="nofollow"`` attribute added
    to them.
    
    For example::
    
        {{ value|urlize }}
    
    If ``value`` is ``"Check out www.djangoproject.com"``, the output will be
    ``"Check out <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com"
    rel="nofollow">www.djangoproject.com</a>"``.
    
    In addition to web links, ``urlize`` also converts email addresses into
    ``mailto:`` links. If ``value`` is
    ``"Send questions to foo@example.com"``, the output will be
    ``"Send questions to <a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a>"``.
    
    The ``urlize`` filter also takes an optional parameter ``autoescape``. If
    ``autoescape`` is ``True``, the link text and URLs will be escaped using
    Django's built-in :tfilter:`escape` filter. The default value for
    ``autoescape`` is ``True``.
    
    .. note::
    
        If ``urlize`` is applied to text that already contains HTML markup,
        things won't work as expected. Apply this filter only to plain text.
